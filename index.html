<P>An ocean is a continuous body of salt water that is contained in an enormous basin on Earth’s surface. The major oceans and their marginal seas cover nearly 71 percent of Earth’s surface, with an average depth of 3,688 metres (12,100 feet). The five major oceans are the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Southern oceans.The Pacific is the largest ocean in both surface area and volume. The Atlantic is the next largest, and the Arctic is the smallest. By volume, 97.957 percent of the water on Earth exists as oceanic water and associated sea ice. Earth is unique in the solar system because its mean temperature allows water to exist on Earth in all three phases—solid, liquid, and gaseous—with the liquid phase predominating.</P>
